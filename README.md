clubbable
=========

A web application for managing newsletters and image galleries for a club.

Requirements
------------

Python library requirements are listed in requirements.txt.

clubbable's importmdb.py utility also requires [mdbtools][1] to import data from
a Microsoft Access database. You may be able to install it from your operating
system's repository. e.g.

    $ sudo apt-get install mdbtools

It is available from the [mdbtools homepage][1].

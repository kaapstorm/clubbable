================================

*clubbable* is a website that lets you send club notices to members, and manage
image galleries for members to browse.

If you currently manage club membership using a Microsoft Access database, you
may be able[#]_ to import your data into *clubbable*.


.. [#] The database import tool will probably need to be customised for your
       specific Microsoft Access database. If you are not a software developer,
       you will probably need a software developer to do that for you. The good
       news is that all the source code for *clubbable* is available free of
       charge, to use and to modify however you like, `on the Internet`_.

  The Owl Club of Cape Town has been many
  things to many men---host to a long succession of
  famous visitors; home of good fellowship, of music,
  of art, of literature, a refuge where men who move
  in solemn walks of life among us may forget for an
  evening now and then their necessary dignity and be
  just their natural selves; a shrine for tobacco and
  plain food and good liquor in moderation. All these
  things it has been and is, and because of them has
  lived and flourished through many happy and careless
  and unjealous years.

  ---From the *Cape Times*, 5 December 1921
